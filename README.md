# streamdisc

Tiny linux application that makes non-encrypted DVD and BD content available over the network.

Available as 
- cgi module (streamdisc_cgi) integrating into an existing cgi capable web server, or as
- standalone server (streamdisc_server).

Integrates perfectly into kodi/xbmc as it provides a http directory listing (see screenshots):

- add source http://ip-address
![add source](/add_source.png)

- browse new source

Dependencies:
